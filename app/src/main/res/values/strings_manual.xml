    <string name="titlepage4">Interaction with Responsible and Executor</string>
    <string name="page4">&lt;H3>Interaction with Responsible and Executor.&lt;/H3>
&lt;p>Responsible is a person, who appointed you this task.
&lt;p>Executor is a person, who was appointed  by you to perform this task. 
&lt;p>You can define an executor for a task in its form by selecting  a contact from the \"Contacts\" or by inputting of a particular phone number or an email.
&lt;p>If an executor is chosen from the contact list and you would like to input another phone number or an email, press \"Clear\" in a context menu and input the new data. 
&lt;p>The task can be sent  to the executor by sms or email. The executor will receive a message (sms or email) in which the following data is defined: your code of the task, the name and the due date of the task. 
&lt;p>To send a message to the executor select \"Menu\" in the form of the task and then select a type of the message (either sms or email).
&lt;p>By receiving of the message in the application of the executor a new task will be created, in which in the field \"Responsible\", your contact will be defined (or your phone number/email, if you are not on his contact list).
&lt;p>A responsible can be chosen in the same way.
&lt;p>If in \"Settings\" a check box \"Send a message on new status to a responsible automatically\" is checked, then by changing of the status in the task list, a message with the new status will be sent to the responsible automatically. 
&lt;p>If for the responsible an email and a phone number are chosen, then:
&lt;p>-	If in \"Settings\" a check box \"First try to send  status by email. Else, if there is no email, send by sms\", then the sending will be done in this sequence;
&lt;p>-	Otherwise, when changing of status there exists the possibility to select how to send status.
&lt;p>To send emails, email settings can be defined in \"Settings\".
&lt;p>An example of an interaction. \"Mom\" creates a task \"Buy milk\" and chooses an executor from her contact list as \"Son\". \"Mom\" sends the task to \"Son\" from \"Menu\". \"Son\" receives this task, its form appears on his screen. After the changing of the status of the task to \"Completed\", the status is changed and visible in \"Mom’s\" application automatically.
